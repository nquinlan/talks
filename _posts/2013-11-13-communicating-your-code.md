{% slide 001-001 %}

> As developers we talk about code every day: to technical people, non-technical people, people who know more about systems than us, and people who know less. Each has different frames of reference and must be told things differently. This talk will explore methods of communication for each type of audience and the processes behind them. Understand how to sell your ideas to your boss, explain what you do to your parents, teach other developers, and solicit feedback better.
